Dear selection committee,

I am a 
%statistics and 
statistical machine learning researcher with extensive experience
collaborating with biologists and medical doctors. I am interested to
become the next Assistant Professor of Biostatistics 
at the University of Texas MD Cancer Center.

My research contributions are very compatible with your focus on
genomics and high-throughput sequencing data. Most of my research
contributions are to the statistics and machine learning literature,
about models and algorithms for analyzing large biological data sets.
I have a lot of experience with high throughput sequencing data and
time series analysis (in particular optimal changepoint detection
algorithms).  I have contributed many packages to the R language and
environment for data analysis, so that my algorithms can be widely
used for analyzing biological data sets.
%Finally, most
Most of my applications papers are collaborations with biologists and
medical doctors, which I will be excited to continue. 

My experiences in the international academic community will certainly
add some diversity to your department. I have worked in France, Japan,
and Canada, and I speak fluent French. Please note my Ph.D. studies in
France took only 3 years (2009-2012), which is typical there.
% In France there are no transcripts for doctoral studies, so instead I
% attach a photocopy of an official letter in English, ``Certificate of
% the Award of a Doctoral Degree.'' I do have transcripts for my
% Bachelors and Masters degrees, if that is necessary. 
I have been
pursuing postdoctoral research since 2013, so for my letters of
recommendation, I have asked my current postdoc advisor and
collaborators.

My teaching contributions include creating course materials for
university courses, international conference tutorials, and informal
seminars for my research groups. I have also mentored several students
in research and coding projects. Although teaching has not been a
major focus for me in the past, I am committed to make teaching a
priority in the years to come.

% My vision for teaching statistics includes an emphasis on machine
% learning and data visualization methods for analyzing large data
% sets. I think that it is absolutely critical to both understand the
% mathematics behind statistical models, and to be able to implement
% algorithms in practice on computers. I contribute extensively to R,
% which I believe is as valuable for teaching as it is for research. I
% am excited to develop new course materials with which I will
% communicate my enthusiasm about these subjects to a new generation of
% statistics students.

% Finally, I grew up in California and I have visited Arizona several
% times in childhood. I would be interested to move to Flagstaff to
% enjoy the beautiful natural environment.

Thanks in advance for your consideration.

Sincerely,
